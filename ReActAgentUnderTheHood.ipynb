    "Let's start with some concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt engineering**\n",
    "  * A prompt is an input given to an LLM to elicit a contextually relevant response from it based on the information present in its training data.\n",
    "  * Prompt engineering is an iterative process of crafting prompts to an LLM to drive it to generate a more relevant text with higher probability without needing to fine-tune the models.\n",
    "  * Why do we need it ? The output of an LLM to a prompt is generated by the model and its quality and relevance to the prompt largely depends on the finding the matching (statistical) patterns in the training data. By carefully prompting, we can tailor its output so that it is precise and privides answer to the specific question; we can control output's tone and style and some times even mitigate model bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can LLM do reasoning ?**\n",
    "  * Could do a reasonable job spiltting complex task into smaller steps, if guided with carefully engineered prompts.\n",
    "  * Chain-Of-Thought (CoT) reasonging is a prompt engineering technique that is used to carefully craft prompt and instruct an LLM to better reason about each part of the question through intermediate steps and produce the text (answer).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can LLM do fact checking ?**\n",
    "  * Unless fine tuned with latest and greatest data and or with specific domain knowledge (like latest world events, personalization data for each user) it will just hallucinate and generate (pseudo-)facts only, for example even with CoT as LLM does not know how reach out to external sources to update its knowledge.\n",
    "  * An alternative to fine-tuning is via Action prompt engineering technique. Basically, prompting an LLM to generate structured output like JSON blob which can be parsed and interpreted by an entity like agent (for example make calls to external systems like personalizaion data) and then re-prompt LLM with these details added in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ReAct (Reason+Action)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combines best of both worlds: CoT, Action\n",
    "* Reasons through thought process (CoT), interacts with environment to get additional knowledge via actions (Action) into observation. Cycles through thought, action, observation till believes it gotten correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "These probably sound abstract for some one new to this field. So, let's dive into code to see ReAct in action step by step."
